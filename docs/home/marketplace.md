### How SphereHUB Marketplace Stands Out

While most NFT marketplaces charge **2–15% fees** on every trade, SphereHUB is built to empower both collectors and creators:

* **Fees**
  * **Other:** 2% – 15% trading fees.
  * **SphereHUB:** only **0.5% – 1%**, among the lowest in the industry.
* **Features**
  * **Other:** standard buy/sell, filtering, and collection pages.
  * **SphereHUB:** full suite of tools (sorting, rarity filters, advanced analytics, real-time pricing) — all included with lower fees.
*   **Protocol Revenue**

    * **Other:** revenue goes to platforms and investors.
    * **SphereHUB:** **100% of protocol revenue is distributed to SphereHUB NFT holders**, creating direct value for the community.
